#  Final Submission for DSA Case Study Project
This is the final submission for the DSA case study project, as required by Incubator Hub. The project was started on June 24th and completed on July 4th.

## Acknowledgement
I would like to thank Incubator Hub and Daddy GO for providing us with the opportunity to work on this project. Their guidance and support have been invaluable in helping us complete this project.

## Documentation
The documentation consists of a dashboard sheet with four graphs and a pivot table.

### Dashboard Sheet
The dashboard sheet includes the following graphs:

1. **Top 5 Products with High Discount** : A pie chart displaying the top 5 products with the highest discounts, along with their percentage values.

### Pivot Table
The pivot table provides additional insights into the data. Although I encountered some issues with enabling distinct count on column AD in Excel, I have ensured that the rest of the pivot table is accurate according to my understanding.

## Limitations
One limitation of the project was the inability to enable distinct count on column AD in Excel, which prevented me from including the number of unique products by price range in the graphs.
